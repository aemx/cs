# Undergraduate Computer Science at NJIT

This repository contains a growing collection of undergraduate coursework completed for Computer Science courses at the [New Jersey Institute of Technology](http://www.njit.edu/). Note that, I am not pursuing a Computer Science major, but rather a _Computer Engineering_ major (as a sophomore).

## Disclaimer

It is highly recommended that this collection be used for exemplary and historical purposes only. It is also recommended that you do not use these programs to plagiarize the coursework for your own needs at NJITâ€” I am not held responsible for your actions if you choose to do this. Be warned that the decision to disobey the [Academic Honor Code](https://www.njit.edu/doss/policies/honorcode/index.php) set in place at NJIT may result in your suspension or expulsion from the university.

## Course Listing

### [CS 115 - Intro. to CS I in C++](http://catalog.njit.edu/search/?P=CS%20%20%20115)

Fundamentals of computer science are introduced, with emphasis on programming methodology and problem solving. Topics include basic concepts of computer systems, software engineering, algorithm design, programming languages and data abstraction, with applications. The high level language C++ is fully discussed and serves as the vehicle to illustrate many of the concepts.
